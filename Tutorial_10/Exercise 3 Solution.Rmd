output: word_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Combining Code and Text
- You might want to include both the code chunk and code output in your final document like below:

```{r codeAndOutput}
numbers <- c(1, 4, 6, 7)
sum(numbers)
```


- Sometimes you may prefer to simply include the output from your code:

```{r justOutput, echo=FALSE}
sum(numbers)
```

## Plotting In R Markdown
- The inclusion of plots in your reports can really enhance their effectiveness.

### Scatterplot
- This scatterplot was created using the **cars** dataset from the *datasets* package.

```{r carsScatterplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot of Cars Dataset"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = cars)+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist))
```
