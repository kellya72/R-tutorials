```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This week's tutorial will provide a more in depth look at vectors and introduce matrices. Useful functions for data manipulation such as `rbind`, `cbind` and `apply` will also feature.  

- Before you start on this weeks tutorial, open a new R Script in RStudio and set the working directory to the **R Tutorials** file from last week. 

## The Help Function
- The help function is a very useful tool in R. 

- Adding a `?` before any function will load a help file on that function which details what it does, the parameters it takes and provides examples of its use.

- Run `?mean` and examine the help file shown.

## Matrices in R
- A matrix is a two dimensional array of data. 

- A matrix is created in R using the `matrix` function which takes the format `matrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow= FALSE)` where `data` is the input to the matrix, `nrow` is the number of rows in the matrix and `ncol` is the number of columns. By default the matrix is filled by column, however this can be changed to by row by setting the `byrow` parameter equal to `TRUE`. 

- Below is an example of how to create a basic matrix with the resulting matrix shown underneath:

```{r matix}
myMatrix <- matrix(c(1,3,4,7,2,1,9,5,3), nrow=3, ncol= 3)
myMatrix
```

**Exercise 1: Recreate the matrix shown below in R and name it `testScores`.**

```{r matrix2, echo=FALSE}
testScores <- matrix(c(70,43,81,59,75,59,88,63,68,46,83,61), nrow=4, ncol=3)
testScores
```

## Naming Rows and Columns
- It is possible to name the rows and columns in a matrix using the `rownames()` and `colnames()` functions.

- Firstly, name the columns in `testScores` by typing the following code:

```{r colnames}
colnames(testScores) <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar")
```

**Excerise 2: Name the rows in testScores Katie, Robert, Niamh and Nick.**
```{r rownames, echo=FALSE}
rownames(testScores) <- c("Katie", "Robert","Niamh", "Nick")

```

## Selecting values in a Matrix
- Similar to vectors, variables in a matrix are selected using indices. However this time to get a specific variable you must input two indices; the row index and the column index. 

- To select the value in the first row and third column of a matrix you would use the following format: `matrixName[1,3]`. Note that the row index is specified first and then column index second, after a comma. 

- Some examples of selecting values from matrices are shown below. Do you understand the output returned by each line of code?

```{r selectOne}
myMatrix[2,3]
```

```{r selectMutliple}
myMatrix[1:2,3]
```
- It is possible to select an entire row or column from a matrix.
```{r selectRow}
myMatrix[1,]
```
```{r selectColumn}
myMatrix[,2]
```

## Selecting Values using Row and Column Names
- One useful element of naming rows and columns is that they can be used to select variables in the matrix. This is especially useful when trying to access data in a large matrix. 

- Try running the code below yourself, checking that you get the same answers.

```{r}
testScores["Niamh","Feb"]
```

```{r}
testScores["Nick", c("Jan", "Mar")]
```

```{r}
testScores[,"Feb"]
```

## Rbind and Cbind 
- The `rbind` and `cbind` functions allow you to add rows and columns to an existing matrix respectively. 

- For example, if we wanted to add test scores from April to the existing `testScores` matrix we would do so as follows:
```{r addCol}
Apr <- c(72,53,85,64)
testScores <- cbind(testScores, Apr)
testScores
```
- Run the code above before starting Exercise 3.

**Exercise 3: The testScores matrix is missing a student named Lucy. Use the `rbind()` function to add her scores in. Lucy has test scores of 61, 64, 70 and 63 for the months of January, February, March and April respectively.**

```{r addRow, echo=FALSE}
Lucy <- c(61, 64, 70, 63)
testScores <- rbind(testScores, Lucy)
```

## The Apply Function
- The `apply()` function returns the result obtained when a set function is applied to a matrix.

- The function takes the following format: `apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)` where `X` is the matrix and `FUN` is the chosen function. The `MARGIN` parameter refers to whether you wish to apply the function to the rows or columns of the matrix. `MARGIN` is set to `1` for rows and `2` for columns.

- For example, if you wanted to find the average test score for each month you would do the following:

```{r}
apply(testScores, 2, mean)
```

**Exercise 4: Find each individuals max test score. Hint: use the `max()` function.**

## Editing Data in Matrix
- It is very easy to access and edit data in a matrix. 

- For example, from looking at the average test score values by month in `testScores`, it was thought that the January test must have been too hard. As a result, it was decided that each student would get 5 extra marks for their January test.

- The code below shows how to make the necessary charges to the matrix.

```{r}
testScores[,"Jan"] <- testScores[,"Jan"]+5
testScores
```

- The following exercises are more challenging that the previous ones. If you are comfortable with the material so far give them a go. 

**Exercise 5: It was discovered that Niamh's February test score was inputted incorrectly and should be 78 instead of 88. Make the necessary update to `testScores`.**

**Exercise 6: Robert has appealed his test scores and as a result has been granted a 20% increase in the marks received for each test. Update `testScores` with Robert's new result.**
