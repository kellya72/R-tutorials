## Movie Dataset {.tabset}

### Introduction

The dataset on movies appeared as part of the [tidy tuesday series](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-10-23). The data originally came from [the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/).  

There are `r nrow(movie)` movies in the dataset, for `r length(unique(movie$genre))` different genres.  

#### Document

This html document will show a brief exploration of the dataset. The accompanying R Markdown document shows various examples of Markdown code and it's uses.

### Exploration

The `str` function shows the structure of the dataset.  

```{r}
str(movie)
```

<br>  

#### Dates

The results from using `str` shows that the date is currently stored as a character, which means that if we tried to sort by date it would not work as you would want/expect.  
Using `min` the minimum is: **`r min(movie$release_date)`** and using `max` the maximum is **`r max(movie$release_date)`**.  


This behaviour can be fixed by changing the date column from a character type to a date type. It is also possible to extract the year as a new column.  

```{r tidy data}
 # Tidy dates and calculate return
movie_tidy <- movie %>% 
  select(-X1) %>%  # remove row names
  mutate(release_date = lubridate::mdy(release_date),  # tidy date
         release_year = lubridate::year(release_date),  # tidy year
         return = worldwide_gross - production_budget)  # calculate return
```

Now we the minimum is: **`r min(movie_tidy $release_date)`** and the maximum is **`r max(movie_tidy $release_date)`**.  

<br>  

#### Summary Stats

We will explore the data by creating summary statistics for each year and each genre.  

The `group_by` function will group together the movies based on whichever columns you select. In the case below, release_year and genre.  
The `summarise` function will then calculate various statistics for the grouped variables.  
  
```{r summarise data}
  # Aggregate and summarise data by year and genre
movie_tidy %>% 
  group_by(release_year, genre) %>%
  summarise(avg_return = mean(return), 
            median_return = median(return),
            avg_production = mean(production_budget), 
            median_production = median(production_budget),
            avg_gross = mean(worldwide_gross), 
            median_gross = median(worldwide_gross)) -> movie_agg

```


The `movie_agg` dataset contains the summary statistics.  

```{r display tidy data}
movie_agg
```
 

### Visualisation


```{r plot data 1, fig.align='center'}

average_return_plot <- ggplot(movie_agg, aes(x = release_year, y = avg_return, colour=genre)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(scale=0.000001, suffix="M")) +  # Change y-axis labels to dollars
  labs(title = "Average Return", x = "Year", y = NULL, colour = NULL)  # remove legend title

average_return_plot
```


```{r plot data 2, fig.align='center'}
  # ggplot of median production cost versus year by genre
yearly_cost_plot <- ggplot(movie_agg, aes(release_year, median_production, colour=genre)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(scale=0.000001, suffix="M")) +  # Change y-axis labels to dollars
  labs(title = "Median Production Cost", x = "Year", y = NULL, colour = NULL)  # remove legend title

yearly_cost_plot
```

#### Plotly (optional)

```{r plotly example, message=FALSE}
if(require(shiny) && require(plotly)){  # check if installed
  # Create plotly graph
  yearly_cost_plotly <- ggplotly(yearly_cost_plot) %>% 
    layout(margin = list(l = 45))  # add extra space on left for axis labels
  
  shiny::div(yearly_cost_plotly, align = "center")  # need the div function to centre the graph on the webpage
}
```
